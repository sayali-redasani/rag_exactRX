# Deployment Process to Azure Container Apps

This guide outlines the steps to deploy a ReactJS frontend and Flask backend application using Docker and Azure Container Apps.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository for your project
- DockerHub account (for storing Docker images)
- Azure account with access to Azure Container Apps

## Steps

### 1. Directory Setup

Create two directories in your GitHub repository:
- `frontend` for ReactJS frontend code
- `backend` for Flask backend code

### 2. Dockerfile Creation

Create separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend based on the specific requirements of each:
- Example Dockerfiles:
  - `frontend/Dockerfile`
  - `backend/Dockerfile`

### 3. GitHub Actions Configuration

Navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository and set up Docker build and push workflows:
- Use Dockerfile templates provided by GitHub Actions
- Configure YAML files (`docker-build-push.yml`, for example) to build Docker images for frontend and backend and push them to DockerHub

### 4. Dockerize and Push to DockerHub

Ensure your GitHub Actions workflow Dockerizes both frontend and backend and pushes the Docker images to your DockerHub repository.

### 5. Deploy Backend to Azure Container Apps

- Deploy the backend Docker image first to Azure Container Apps.
- Obtain the endpoint URL provided by Azure Container Apps after deployment.

### 6. Integrate Backend Endpoint

Update your frontend code with the backend's endpoint URL obtained from Azure Container Apps.

### 7. Push Updated Code

Commit and push the updated code to your GitHub repository. This triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically Dockerize the updated code.

### 8. Deploy Frontend to Azure Container Apps

- Deploy the frontend Docker image to Azure Container Apps.
- Obtain the endpoint URL provided by Azure Container Apps after deployment.

### 9. Testing

Verify that your application works correctly:
- Access the frontend URL provided by Azure Container Apps and ensure it communicates properly with the backend.
- Test thoroughly to confirm functionality matches the local environment setup.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully deployed your ReactJS frontend and Flask backend applications to Azure Container Apps using Docker, GitHub Actions, DockerHub, and Azure services.
